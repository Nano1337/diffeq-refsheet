\textbf{Mixing Problems}: 
$dx/dt = r_{in} - r_{out}$, where r(t) can also be salt concentration, if so, then 
$dx/dt = r_{in}c_{in} - r_{out}x(t)/V$, where x(t) is [salt]
\textbf{Malthusian/Exponential Model}: 
$dP/dt = kp, p(0)=p_0$, $p(t) = p_0*exp(kt)$ 
\textbf{Logistic Model}:
$dP/dt = k_1p-k_2\frac{p(p-1)}{2}$, $p(t) = \frac{p_0p_1}{p_0 + (p_1-p_0)exp(-Ap_1t)}$
\textbf{Newton's Law of Cooling}: 
$T(t) = exp(-kt)\int exp(kt)(kM + H + U)dt + C*exp(-kt)$, where
$M$ is initial temp, $H$ is heat ($\geq 0$), $U$ is heating(+)/cooling rate(-). 
Oscillating $M$ Problem: Given time constant (1/k) and M varies as sine wave w/ min/max time/temp given, find min/max time/temp of building. 
% 1. Find period $\omega = 2\pi/24hr$, $M_0 + B = T_
